The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and continues to prompt the user for guesses until they correctly guess the number. Once the correct number is guessed, the program prints out the number of guesses it took the user to correctly guess the number.
